description of the programs:

# AG

# ANGLCHNG
kinda broken and very incomplete angle change program that converts between 
different angle measure systems 

# GAME
higher/lower number game

# GDPDEF
GDP deflator for econ

# MPSORMPC
Calculates MPS or MPC and the corresponding spending and tax multiplier
used for econ

# PERCHANG
Calculates percent change between two numbers

# PNTCHANG
second in amazingness only to trig program
swaps coordinates between rectangular and polar systems
must be in radian mode

# TRIAREA
triangle area calculator 
choice between 4 different methods of solving for area:
-Heron's formula
-The one with sin(inside angle)
-Default base * height
-Triangle portion of a circle sector
-a little bonus: just a circle sector area

# TRIG
my favorite and most comprehensive program to this day
likely a little bugged, but as long as you use degree mode it should always
give the right answer. 
it should always ask for three inputs, and the letters by themselves
are the angles. 
triangles are specified by S and A method (ie SSA or SAS triangle)

# VARSWAP
Swaps two previously defined variables
